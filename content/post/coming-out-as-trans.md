title = "Coming out as Trans as work"

+++

I've made a short video about my experiences coming out as a trans woman at work. It's something that I've wanted to talk about for a while, but I don't think would fit in at a conference.

I'm putting this out there because I want trans people who're thinking about transitioning at work, particularly in the UK, and particularly in software to know they're not alone, and that if I can do this, they can too.

Enjoy!
