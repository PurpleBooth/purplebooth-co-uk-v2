I'm interested in helping someone else develop their skills by mentoring. If you think that that could be you, drop me an [email](mailto:mentoring@purplebooth.co.uk).

I'm looking for someone who wants to learn about good object orientation practices, who has an interest in TDD and BDD. Primarily I'm a PHP or Java developer, however I have some experience with NodeJs or Ruby so it would easiest for me to explain examples in those languages.

I am also willing to answer questions regarding supporting trans people in your organisation, and anything regarding coming out to co-workers or anything else you might have as trans/questioning person in the tech industry. Obviously I can only answer from my own personal experience in this regard.

My timezone is Europe/London.

Billie
